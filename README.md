## üõ†Ô∏è **Overview**
This project is a **comprehensive solution** designed to address post-collision requirements in automobiles. The system is tailored to provide timely alerts to emergency contacts in the event of an accident, ensuring **quicker medical intervention** by sharing the collision site's location. The **portable** and **affordable** design allows it to be integrated into any vehicle, regardless of its model or brand. This system is especially beneficial for drivers of budget or older model cars.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**
- üö® **Emergency Alert Notification**: Automatically sends alerts to predefined emergency contacts in case of a collision.
- üìç **Location Sharing**: Shares the precise location of the collision site to facilitate timely medical assistance. Shares google maps pin.
- üöô **Universal Compatibility**: Portable design ensures easy integration into vehicles of any make or model.
- üí∏ **Cost-Effective**: Affordable solution, making advanced safety accessible for budget or older vehicles.

## üéØ **Project Goals**
1. **Reduce Delay in Medical Assistance**: Minimize the time required for emergency services to reach the site of an accident.
2. **Enhance Safety for Budget and Older Cars**: Bring advanced safety features to vehicles that typically lack modern amenities.
3. **Ease of Integration**: Provide a user-friendly and portable solution suitable for all vehicles.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aj-sn/Collision-Solution-System-D-Safe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory in MPLABX IDE:
   ```bash
   File -> open projects -> Collision-Solution-System-D-Safe -> firmware -> Collision Solution System.X (select)
   Production -> Set Main Project -> Collision Solution System.X (select)
   Build and Flash(Check project properites to make sure the microcontroller used is ATSAMD21J18A and compiler is Microchip's XC32)
   ```
3. Follow the setup instructions provided in the `docs/SETUP.md` file for hardware setup (coming soon...)

---

## üöÄ **Usage** (this is a prototype)
1. Setup and wire the system as described in the `docs/SETUP.md` guide.
2. Predefine your emergency contact(s).
3. Build, flash, and power up the system; it will automatically monitor for collisions and send alerts when necessary.

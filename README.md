# Collision-Solution-System-D-Safe
# Post-Collision Emergency Alert System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive solution designed to address post-collision requirements in automobiles. The system is tailored to provide timely alerts to emergency contacts in the event of an accident, ensuring quicker medical intervention by sharing the collision site's location. The portable and affordable design allows it to be integrated into any vehicle, regardless of its model or brand. This system is especially beneficial for drivers of budget or older model cars.

## Key Features
- **Emergency Alert Notification**: Automatically sends alerts to predefined emergency contacts in case of a collision.
- **Location Sharing**: Shares the precise location of the collision site to facilitate timely medical assistance. Shares google maps pin.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Portable design ensures easy integration into vehicles of any make or model.
- **Cost-Effective**: Affordable solution, making advanced safety accessible for budget or older vehicles.

## Project Goals
1. **Reduce Delay in Medical Assistance**: Minimize the time required for emergency services to reach the site of an accident.
2. **Enhance Safety for Budget and Older Cars**: Bring advanced safety features to vehicles that typically lack modern amenities.
3. **Ease of Integration**: Provide a user-friendly and portable solution suitable for all vehicles.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aj-sn/Collision-Solution-System-D-Safe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory in MPLABX IDE:
   ```bash
   File -> open projects -> Collision-Solution-System-D-Safe -> firmware -> Collision Solution System.X (select)
   Production -> Set Main Project -> Collision Solution System.X (select)
   Build and Flash(Check project properites to make sure the microcontroller used is ATSAMD21J18A and compiler is Microchip's XC32)
   ```
3. Follow the setup instructions provided in the `docs/SETUP.md` file for hardware setup (coming soon...)

## Usage (this is a prototype)
1. Setup and wire the system as described in the `docs/SETUP.md` guide.
2. Predefine your emergency contact(s).
3. Build, flash, and power up the system; it will automatically monitor for collisions and send alerts when necessary.

## Dependencies
- [System] - details coming soon (hardware modules, wirings, etc.).
- [Software] - MPLABX IDE, Microchip XC32 compiler, code editor of your choice.
